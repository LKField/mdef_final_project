# MDEF Final Project 

For this project, I will be creating a 'mended laptop' which will run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

The functionality will include: 
- Speaker and audio jack outout, handled by a DFPLayer mini 
- A 'track pad' touch sensor 
- A language toggle button 
- LED indicators to show which audio file is playing
